# Student-Database-Management-System
Students and administrators can add new student records. 
Administrators can securely retrieve and delete student records.

The CSS files should be migrated to a CSS folder ("css")
and the JS file should be dumped into a separate JS folder ("js"),
which are both in the same master directory as the other PHP & HTML files. 
Image files should be unzipped into the directory, from pictures.zip.

website.HTML is the main site and serves as a linking tool to other files. 
There are 3 PHP files for adding a new student, fetching student data and logging into the database.
The last PHP file sets up the connection to the students database for the other files. 

Also included is a sample MySQL database used for storing student records.
