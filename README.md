# Student-Database-Management-System
Students and administrators can add new student records. Administrators can securely retrieve and delete student records.

If you are downloading the files, some of the relative linking will not work. 
In particular, the CSS files should be migrated to a CSS folder
and the JS file should be dumped into a separate JS folder 
that are in the same master directory as the other PHP & HTML files. 

HTML file is the main website. 
There are 3 PHP files for adding a new student, fetching student data and logging into the database.
The last PHP file makes the connection for the other files. 

Optimized for display on Google Chrome.
